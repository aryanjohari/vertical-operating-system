However, the HTML structure for H3 tags is incorrect; they are invalidly nested (e.g., `<h3><h3>Am I eligible...</h3></h3>`) instead of simply `<h3>Am I eligible...</h3>`. While H2 tags are correctly implemented, the consistent misuse of H3 tags is a significant structural error for a strict editor, warranting a score below the passing threshold.",
