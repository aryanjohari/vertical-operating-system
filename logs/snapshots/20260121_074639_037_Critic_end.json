    "message": "\u274c Rejected Legal aid for ex-offenders [City] near North Shore District Court (73): The content addresses the three criteria as follows:\n\n1.  **Phone Number:** A phone number (021 280 6655) is clearly present at the end of the document, making it easy for users to contact the service.\n\n2.  **H2/H3 Tags:** Both `<h2>` and `<h3>` tags are present and used to structure the content. HOWEVER, there is a critical HTML structural error: the `<h3>` tags within the 'Frequently Asked Questions' section are incorrectly nested (`<h3><h3>Question?</h3></h3>`). This is invalid HTML and indicates a lack of attention to basic web standards, which a strict editor finds unacceptable.\n\n3.  **Robotic Language:** The content successfully avoids the specific type of robotic language exemplified by words like 'delve', 'unleash', or 'elevate'. While the tone is professional and formal, it generally maintains a clear, direct, and empathetic voice, avoiding excessive corporate jargon or clich\u00e9s that would make it sound insincere or robotic.\n\nThe significant HTML structural error with the nested `<h3>` tags is a major flaw for a strict editor, heavily impacting the overall quality score.",
